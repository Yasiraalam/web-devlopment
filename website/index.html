          Computer programming is the process of performing a particular
          computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing
          result), usually by designing and building an executable computer
          program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating
          algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption,
          and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming
          language, commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a
          program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to
          programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by
          the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a
          sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task
          (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often
          for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus usually
          requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge
          of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.
          Tasks accompanying and related to programming include testing,
          debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems,
          and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of
          computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming
          process, but often the term software development is used for this
          larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding
          reserved for the actual writing of code. Software engineering combines
          engineering techniques with software development practices. Reverse
          engineering is a related process used by designers, analysts, and
          programmers to understand and re-create/re-implement.

          Competitive programming(With Yasir alam)
        </p>
        <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">
          Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet
          or a local network, involving participants trying to program according
          to provided specifications. Contestants are referred to as sport
          programmers. Competitive programming is recognized and supported by
          several multinational software and Internet companies, such as
          Google and Facebook. A programming competition generally
          involves the host presenting a set of logical or mathematical
          problems, also known as puzzles, to the contestants (who can vary in
          number from tens to several thousands), and contestants are required
          to write computer programs capable of solving each problem. Judging is
          based mostly upon number of problems solved and time spent for writing
          successful solutions, but may also include other factors (quality of
          output produced, execution time, memory usage, program size, etc.) The
          aim of competitive programming is to write source code of computer
          programs which are able to solve given problems. A vast majority of
          problems appearing in programming contests are mathematical or logical
          in nature. Typical such tasks belong to one of the following
          categories: combinatorics, number theory, graph theory, algorithmic
          game theory, computational geometry, string analysis and data
          structures. Problems related to constraint programming and artificial
          intelligence are also popular in certain competitions.

          Reliability: how often the results of a program are correct. This
          depends on conceptual correctness of algorithms and minimization of
          programming mistakes, such as mistakes in resource management (e.g.,
          buffer overflows and race conditions) and logic errors (such as
          division by zero or off-by-one errors). Robustness: how well a program
          anticipates problems due to errors (not bugs). This includes
          situations such as incorrect, inappropriate or corrupt data,
          unavailability of needed resources such as memory, operating system
          services, and network connections, user error, and unexpected power
          outages. Usability: the ergonomics of a program: the ease with which a
          person can use the program for its intended purpose or in some cases
          even unanticipated purposes. Such issues can make or break its success
          even regardless of other issues. This involves a wide range of
          textual, graphical, and sometimes hardware elements that improve the
          clarity, intuitiveness, cohesiveness and completeness of a program's
          user interface.
